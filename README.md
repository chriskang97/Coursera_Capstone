# BBQ Data Analysis Capstone Project
Contains work done for the Coursera Capstone course provided by IBM on coursera. Project focuses on attempting in attempting to determine if any variables have a higher statisical significance in influencing a restaurant's success. Data collection, visualization, and analysis are done within Jupyter Notebooks. 

### Data Collection
Data collection was done on the FourSquare database. Collection was partially done with the FourSquare API and was mostly done with the save_text_pickle.py macro file. Finalized datasets and Panda Dataframe are in the datasets folder in pickle format. 

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was done on the the dataset collected. A lot of the restaurants had missing attributes or invalid formats and thus had to be updated. 

### Data Visualization/Modeling
Showcases several visualization on the dataset itself along with some statiscal analysis ranging from correlation, percentage of restaurants that had all their attirbutes, etc. Finalized report and findings are found in Report Presentation folder. 

### Additional Notes 
Datasets is open for anyone to use. However, due to the amount of missing values and assumptions made, many assumptions had to made regarding these values and thus may not accurately represent the current restaurant.
